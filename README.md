# RandomPassword

# 🔐 Random Password Generator (Python)
This is a simple Python script to generate a strong, random password of a given length using letters, digits, and special characters.

## 🧾 How it works
- It uses the `random` and `string` modules in Python.
- Characters are randomly picked from:
  - Uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Digits
  - Special characters (punctuation)
- The generated password uses `*` as a separator between each character (you can remove it if not needed).
